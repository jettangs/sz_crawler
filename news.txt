This step makes us even more attractive as a supplier to major customers,&#x201D; says Jean-Marc Vesselle, head of the Liquid Purification Technologies business unit at LANXESS.<br><br>The market for reverse osmosis membrane elements is currently projected to continue growing at an above-average annual rate of ten percent (CAGR 2015-2020) in the years ahead. Because the plant was already operating almost at the limit of its capacity, LANXESS decided to double it. <br><br>Production of membrane elements for the Lewabrane line is a multi-stage process. It begins with the fabrication of a thin-film composite membrane comprising several individual layers. A polysulfone base layer and an active filter layer are applied on a nonwoven base substrate. The filter layer is made of polyamide and applied in a complex coating process. Produced as flat components, the reverse osmosis membranes are then wound by fully automated autowinders into spiral-shaped elements. This design helps to conduct untreated water towards the membrane surface and to collect the permeate (filtrate).<br>\fIn addition to the membrane elements plant, LANXESS also operates the world&#x2019;s largest plant for monodisperse ion exchange resins in Bitterfeld.<br><br><strong>New Lewabrane ULP range expands membrane portfolio for water treatment</strong><br><br>LANXESS has been continuously expanding its line of membrane elements since production began in September 2011 and the products were introduced to the market in early 2012. Today, numerous types of Lewabrane elements are available in different sizes, which can be optimized for high fouling resistance, high energy efficiency or high performance.<br><br>The new Lewabrane RO ULP line is the latest addition. These &#x201C;Ultra Low Pressure&#x201D; elements display higher water permeability than the standard elements, while offering the same high level of rejection of critical substances. The operating pressure required in the pressure vessel is 40 percent lower, which reduces operating costs. Furthermore, the new membranes are a good option for removing micropollutants from wastewater and drinking water. <br><br><strong>LANXESS at Aquatech 2017</strong><br><br>As an exhibitor at Aquatech 2017, from October 31 to November 3 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, LANXESS will be showcasing its Lewatit-brand ion exchangers, its Lewabrane line of reverse osmosis membrane elements and its Bayoxide iron oxide adsorbers for water treatment. Exhibits will include the new Lewabrane RO ULP line of membrane elements.<br><br>&#x201C;As one of the world-leading suppliers of products and solutions for water treatment and purification, we support our customers in managing scarce water resources as efficiently as possible. Our products meet the highest German and international production and quality standards. At Aquatech, we want to demonstrate our competence as an experienced, all-around supplier to a broad, international, professional public,&#x201D; announced Vesselle.<br><br>The unique LewaPlus software application for integrated system design will also be available for demonstration at the LANXESS stand. It supports the simulation and design of both reverse osmosis (RO) and ion exchange (IEX) processes for water desalination. It is the only planning tool currently available that makes it possible to design highly complex water treatment systems and draw direct comparisons between calculations for RO and IEX processes.<br><br>Detailed information is available online at <a href=\"http://lpt.lanxess.de/\" title=\"Opens internal link in current window\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link-new-window\">http://lpt.lanxess.de/</a>.

It serves as a housing material for a battery management unit (BMU) and two cell monitoring units (CMU). The blend of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and acrylic ester-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA) contains 30 percent by weight glass fibers and a halogen-based flame retardance package. &#x201C;The particular advantages of the material are its extremely low warpage and shrinkage, combined with its high flame retardance. We see great potential for application in precision components for vehicle battery systems,&#x201D; says Marc Marbach, head of Sales Segments E&amp;E in the LANXESS High Performance Materials (HPM) business unit. It took just two-and-a-half years to go from the initial idea to extensive testing and finally to use in full-scale production.<br><br>HELLA fabricates the BMU and CMUs for a German manufacturer of battery systems for motor vehicles. The very flat devices currently are used in the lithium-ion battery system of a German compact car.<br><br><strong>Low tolerances<br><br></strong>The housings of the BMU and CMUs have large, flat surfaces as well as complex geometries along the edges and on the inside. Thanks to their innovative design, they can be injection molded cost-effectively as single components. The contact pins for the connectors must not bend when the housings are mounted on the printed circuit boards. The tolerances for the spacing between the connector mounts and the cut-outs for the pins are therefore extremely close. &#x201C;This is precisely where the outstanding dimensional stability of our blend Pocan AF4130 pays off,&#x201D; explains Marbach. <br><br><strong>UL 94 5VA- and UL f1-listed</strong><br><br>As required for this application, the material achieves the best classification of V-0 (0.75 millimeters) in UL 94 fire testing by the U.S. testing organization Underwriters Laboratories Inc. It further is listed on the UL Yellow Card with a good classification of UL 94 5VA (1.5 millimeters). The material is destined for the injection molding of flame-retardant housing components. It additionally has been given a UL f1 listing for use in outdoor applications involving exposure to UV light and water. &#x201C;Our compound thus has a good chance of also being used for electrical components such as photovoltaic plugs and sockets,&#x201D; says Marbach.<br><br><strong>Low volatile and condensable emissions<br><br></strong>Surfaces made of this thermoplastic are very low-emission, as demonstrated by thermal desorption analyses conducted by LANXESS in accordance with VDA 278 (German Association of the Automotive Industry). &#x201C;It is therefore also suitable for many motor vehicle applications requiring very low volatile and condensable emissions, such as components for the automotive interior,&#x201D; says Marbach. <br><br><strong>Good resistance to common battery electrolytes</strong><br><br>The blend is highly resistant to typical media used in motor vehicles, such as fuels, oils, cleansers and car care products, as proven in extensive media storage tests conducted by LANXESS for HELLA in accordance with the supply specification LV 124, used by many automotive manufacturers. It also displays good resistance to an electrolyte widely used in lithium-ion batteries. The corresponding test was additionally conducted under load in compliance with DIN EN 22088-3. &#x201C;No cracks were evident in the samples even after 1,000 hours of exposure,&#x201D; explains Marbach. <br><br><strong>Comprehensive HiAnt services</strong><br><br>LANXESS provided HELLA with extensive support in developing the housing components. These services are part of its HiAnt customer service package. For example, HPM delivered suggestions for optimal component design, provided all the characteristic material data required for the computer-aided design of the housing parts to meet expected loads and for the mold flow analyses, and supported the initial injection molding trials. The specialty chemicals company further determined the blend&#x2019;s halogenide content for HELLA by means of ion chromatography and conducted odor testing to VDA 270. <br><br></p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b><br>This company release contains certain forward-looking statements, including assumptions, opinions, expectations and views of the company or cited from third party sources.

An innovative material solution for such custom parts is based on the continuous-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites of the Tepex brand made by LANXESS&#x2019;s subsidiary Bond-Laminates GmbH. These enable the manufacture of virtually indestructible engine shields, fuel tank covers and center tunnel covers which were specially developed for the MLB53A platform. They are already in use on several standard models such as the Bentley Bentayga. In the future they will also be applied in the Audi Q7.<br><br>&#x201C;In a trial on a rough and rocky test track, the components withstood the extreme wear and tear of the underbody hitting the surface as well as gravel impact with virtually no damage at all,&#x201D; says Harri Dittmar, Tepex applications developer. On top of that, the composite material simplifies the production process. &#x201C;Custom parts can be produced in the same mold as the corresponding standard vehicle components. Processors don&#x2019;t need to turn other materials and can eliminate investments in additional molds and presses with higher clamping forces,&#x201D; adds Dittmar.<br><br><strong>Simple compression molding process</strong><br><br>The shields and covers for the standard and custom models are both fabricated in a compression molding process using polypropylene-based low-weight reinforced thermoplastics (LWRT). The large LWRT blanks are heated in a convection oven and inserted by a robot into a compression mold that can shape up to four components simultaneously depending on part size. The components are then punched out of the finish-contoured blanks or cut out with a water jet. To fabricate the components for the custom parts, a 0.5-millimeter-thick Tepex insert is additionally placed on top of the LWRT blanks and molded together with them, so that the resulting components have a Tepex surface on the side facing the road.<br><br>The engine shields and the tank covers are manufactured by ElringKlinger Abschirmtechnik AG, based in Sevelen, Switzerland. It uses the LWRT material ElroCoustic. The center tunnel covers are fabricated by R&#xF6;chling SE &amp; Co. KG of Mannheim, Germany, from its own LWRT material called Seeberlite. The inserts for all of the custom parts are made of Tepex dynalite 104-RG 601, comprising a polypropylene matrix in which 47 percent by volume continuous glass fiber rovings are embedded as a single-layer fabric.<br><br><strong>Outstanding sound absorption</strong><br><br>The top layer of Tepex significantly increases the strength, stiffness and above all the toughness of the LWRT components. Dittmar: &#x201C;Because of its unique structure, LWRT additionally has a very good sound-absorbing effect, which would not have been possible with other compression molding compounds and would have meant less comfort.&#x201D; The durability of the composite structure can be increased even more if Tepex is used not only on the side facing the road but also on the inside as an overlay. &#x201C;The result would be a sandwich structure with a core made of LWRT that is even stiffer but nonetheless still lightweight,&#x201D; says Dr. Egon Moos, Product Manager Underbody Systems at R&#xF6;chling Automotive.<br><br><strong>Wide range of applications</strong><br><br>Tepex is used in more than just car underbody panels. It has since become established in many other series applications in automotive lightweight construction. The composite material is shaped and back-injected to make seat backrests, front-end components, brake pedals and bumper crossbars. On account of Tepex&apos;s growing application potential in lightweight automotive engineering, LANXESS has set up a dedicated project group headed by Henrik Plaggenborg that supports partners worldwide through all stages of Tepex component development right up to production launch. <br><br><br>For more detailed information on Tepex properties, applications and processing technologies, go to <a href=\"http://http//:www.bond-laminates.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bond-laminates.com</a>.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b><br>This company release contains certain forward-looking statements, including assumptions, opinions, expectations and views of the company or cited from third party sources.

The Material Protection Products (MPP) business unit&#x2019;s product range is focused on being able now and also in the future to meet regulatory and technical challenges in the field of biocides &#x2013; for example avoiding labeling as a sensitizer &#x2013; and reducing leaching. Nicolas Gallacier, Global Marketing Director for Industrial Preservation &amp; Coatings in LANXESS&#x2019;s MPP business unit, states that: &#x201C;Our regulatory experts are actively involved in association committees and in close contact with the authorities so as to ensure we can help equip our customers for the new legislation. This shows that LANXESS is a competent partner that enables paints and coatings manufacturers to operate successfully on the market.&#x201D;<br><br><strong>Protecting paint</strong><br><br>Biocides protect paints while they are in liquid form during storage, but also once they are applied. This prevents attacks by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae that can lead to unpleasant odors, changes in flow behavior and discoloration. Biocides can avoid these undesired effects by protecting the coating material from being decomposed by microorganisms. This, on the one hand prolongs the shelf life of the paint in the containers and on the other hand maintains the protective function of a coating for as long as possible. <br><br><strong>Adapting the preservation strategy using MIT-free formulations</strong> <br><br>One of the most commonly used in-can preservatives is methylisothiazolinone (MIT). The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has proposed lowering the threshold for sensitizer labeling for this active ingredient significantly, from 1000 ppm to 15 ppm. Since effective dosing starts at 50 ppm, products using MIT as a preservative will soon have to be labeled with the hazard statement &#x201C;H 317&#x201D; (May cause an allergic skin reaction) and the GHS07 pictogram (exclamation mark). GHS stands for &#x201C;Globally Harmonized System,&#x201D; and is an attempt to create a uniform system worldwide for classifying and labeling chemicals. Gallacier says: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t expect the new threshold for labeling MIT as a sensitizing substance to apply before the end of 2018.&#x201D; <br><br>As soon as the new legislation comes into force, it will have significant implications for preserving paints for the DIY market and for professional users. Substances that require an H 317 label will probably only be approved for professional users after that. &#x201C;We are keeping a close eye on the implementation of the new classification and are supporting our customers in adapting their preservation strategies to the new legislation and offering products free of sensitizing products,&#x201D; says Gallacier. <br><br>MIT-free formulations containing combinations of other isothiazolinones (BIT, CMIT/MIT, OIT) and/or bronopol are already available. LANXESS is also testing combinations with non-sensitizing active ingredients.<br><br><strong>Less leaching from the coating</strong> <br><br>Besides labeling of sensitizers, sustainability is another key issue. Paints and coatings manufacturers face the challenge of continuously having to reduce the leaching of biocides from their products even further.<br>At the ECS, LANXESS is showcasing a new generation of preservatives, the &#x201C;Preventol next&#x201D; series. Preventol next A 29-D and Preventol next A 31-D are fungicide/algicide combinations that have achieved excellent results in the laboratory and in two-year external weathering tests in a damp climate. Their innovative slow-release technology meets industry&#x2019;s growing demands for low leaching and environmental impact.<br><br>Detailed information is available online at <a href=\"http://www.protectedbylanxess.com\" title=\"Opens internal link in current window\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link-new-window\">www.protectedbylanxess.com</a>.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p><b>Forward-Looking Statements</b><br>This company release contains certain forward-looking statements, including assumptions, opinions, expectations and views of the company or cited from third party sources.

The scent of almond candles and lavender lingering in the background let spring and summer feelings slowly arise. The color inspiration makes us dream of puristic soft surfaces with a soft touch. While we combine creamy and sweet colors, we wait until spring embraces us with its shiny and bright colors. <br><br><b>Pura Primavera</b> &#x2013; here vibrant colors dominate from yellow over green to blue. We are surrounded by light and air; spring is present wherever we are. The fragrance of lemon brings with it a lively yellow and lime green color. The green colors mirror big gardens that welcome us with serene radiant colors of nature. Enveloping, alive and energetic, this is a dynamic inspiration with bold combinations and completely without shadows. Sunny and light colors accompany us until they reach the stars.<br><br><b>Stile Intenso</b> &#x2013; a trend with a summery bright range of colors. The warm season is characterized by strong and intense style, full of feeling. There are maritime colors ranging from coral red and blue from the sea to the deep green of the ocean forests. These are authentic, pure colors that combine harmoniously with the light pastel tones from spring and are eye-catchers for shoes, bags and jackets.<br><br>As fragrances increase in intensity, the colors deepen in the <b>Estate Profondo</b> trend. It invites us to dream of the endless summer. The intensive colors reflect the color of sweet vanilla ice cream, of endless beaches and the strong blue color of a volcano at sunset. The colors are saturated but never deep &#x2013; a gift from mother nature just like the smell of cumin that combines with a sea breeze during dinner on the beach.<br><br>For more information, go to: <a href=\"http://www.leather.lanxess.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.leather.lanxess.com</a>.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 7.9 billion in 2015 and about 16,700 employees in 29 countries.

It is independently proven to be effective against lethal strains of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.&#xA0; <br><br>Studies carried out by independent international test laboratories have proven that Virkon S inactivates highly pathogenic avian influenza strains in the face of challenging farm conditions such as heavy organic challenge, dilution by rain water and low temperatures, and the broad range of disease-causing organisms that can exist on farms. Virkon S is recommended for use at a dilution of 1:100 for preventative and continuous biosecurity measures to rapidly provide high levels of efficacy. <br><br>The highly efficacious nature of Virkon S has been demonstrated in a series of tests against members of the orthomyxoviridae virus family (including avian influenza H5N1), and would by association be expected to inactivate the H5N8 strain. <br><br><b>Outbreaks of avian influenza in Europe and Asia</b><br><br>With outbreaks of avian influenza H5N8 in Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Netherlands, Denmark, Croatia), as well as in Asia (for example South Korea, India), European veterinary experts have advised poultry producers to heighten their biosecurity vigilance to reduce the likelihood of infectious migratory wild birds from infecting the tens of millions of European birds. Whether the flocks are housed or not, vehicles may pick-up the highly infectious virus and carry the organism onto farms where workers can potentially spread the disease by touch, on their clothing and footwear.<br><br>Virkon S, unlike a number of other disinfectants, remains highly effective in cold winter temperatures, in the presence of organic challenge and across the pH spectrum, without the need to increase its concentration or surface contact time. <br><br>Global head of the disinfectants business at LANXESS Material Production Products, Igor Martin explains, &#x201C;The cornerstone of emergency disease preparation must be to maintain a heightened state of vigilance against Avian Influenza. Control protocols for this highly contagious disease should be based on sound and effective continuous biosecurity measures, as described below,&#xA0; using a disinfectant independently proven to be effective against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains. Effective emergency disease control strategies must be a priority for governments and poultry producers internationally.&#x201D;<br><br><b>Effective biosecurity measures<br></b><br>Poultry producers should ensure that their biosecurity measures are vigilantly enforced and include:<br><br></p><ul class=\"lxs-bullet\"><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Effective biosecurity perimeter controls </li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Transport biosecurity - wheel dips and sprays </li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Disinfectant foot dips </li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Hand washing and protective clothing </li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Avoiding stock coming into contact with wild birds </li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Thorough cleaning of poultry houses with a heavy-duty multipurpose cleanser (e.g. Biosolve Plus)</li><li class=\"lxs-bullet\">Most importantly, regular, thorough and effective disinfection of poultry houses as avian influenza viruses can survive well in water, so simple washing with water alone may assist in their transmission.</li></ul><p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>Material protection solutions from LANXESS</b><br><br>The products of the Material Protection Products business unit are used worldwide in many different applications.

We have almost reached the limit of our current capacity so we are going to double production capacity in the coming year,&#x201D; said Jean-Marc Vesselle, head of the LANXESS Liquid Purification Technologies (LPT) business unit, on the occasion of a celebration of the five-year anniversary of the Lewabrane plant operated by IAB Ionenaustauscher GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of the LANXESS specialty chemicals company. &#x201C;The Lewabrane brand has established a firm place for itself in the market, not least on account of its high quality and performance properties, which both we and our customers expect from &#x2018;Made in Germany&#x2019; products,&#x201D; he added.<br><br>The specialty chemicals company has invested a total of 40 million euros in the site in the last five years alone. In addition to the membrane elements plant, LANXESS also operates the world&#x2019;s largest ion exchange resin plant in Bitterfeld. <br><br>&#x201C;Here in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, LANXESS is truly writing history, something we are really proud of. As a company with a long tradition in water treatment, LANXESS has grown steadily and now occupies a leading position in the market,&#x201D; said Petra Wust, Mayor of Bitterfeld-Wolfen, continuing: &#x201C;Part of the company&#x2019;s philosophy has always been its regional commitment and special bond with Bitterfeld-Wolfen, and I am extremely grateful for that. I wish the company a great deal of continued success!&#x201D;<br><br>Vesselle emphasized the company&#x2019;s association with the site and the region. &#x201C;In 2011 &#x2013; before the membrane plant &#x2013; we had about 100 employees in Bitterfeld. That number has now grown to about 160 and will continue to increase. We value the skills, commitment and reliability of the workers here, which is a key element in our success.&#x201D; <br><br><b>Expansion of capacity to meet increasing demand</b><br><br>The market for RO membrane elements is currently projected to grow at an above-average rate of 10 percent annually in coming years (CAGR 2015-2020). Because the plant is already operating at almost the limit of its capacity, LANXESS has decided to double the corresponding capacity at the Bitterfeld site. The additional capacity is scheduled to come on line in the second half of 2017. The expansion will create up to 10 new jobs.<br><br><b>Commitment to research, training and development</b><br><br>LANXESS is demonstrating its commitment to the Bitterfeld site in a number of different ways, including in Research &amp; Development. In this regard, Vesselle said: &#x201C;We are continuously conducting research in all areas of modern water treatment so that we can continue to provide our customers with the requisite expertise from a single source.&#x201D; For that purpose LANXESS is cooperating with technical universities and other research facilities in the region such as the Fraunhofer Institutes for Factory Operation and Automation (IFF) in Magdeburg and for Microstructure of Materials and Systems (IMWS) in Halle. <br><br>A total of 18 apprentices have started their careers with IAB Ionenaustauscher GmbH since the site was expanded, with eight currently in training. After completion of their training, these chemical production technicians, chemical laboratory assistants, industrial mechanical engineers and electrical engineers for automation technology can look forward to promising careers, not least with the company itself. Of the 10 apprentices who have already completed their training seven were taken on.<br><br><b>Comprehensive water treatment expertise</b><br><br>LANXESS is one of only two companies in the world that offer know-how and products both in membrane elements and ion exchange resins. &#x201C;With this comprehensive water treatment capability we can meet the requirements of customers all over the world,&#x201D; Vesselle remarked. The membrane element plant is the logical continuation of a tradition dating back almost 80 years in Bitterfeld-Wolfen. The industrial production of ion exchange resins began there in 1938, and after the Second World War the Lewatit brand became famous worldwide. LANXESS operates additional production facilities for ion exchange resins in Leverkusen, Germany, and Jhagadia, India.<br><br>Because membrane and ion exchange technology frequently go hand in hand, the development and introduction of the LewaPlus integrated design software was a major contribution to optimally linking the strengths of both technologies. The software, which is continuously being expanded and refined, reflects LANXESS&#x2019;s comprehensive know-how in the field of water treatment.<br><br><b>Membrane elements for a wide range of applications</b><br><br>LANXESS has continuously expanded its line of membrane products since production began in September 2011 and the products were introduced to the market in early 2012. Numerous types of elements are available in different sizes and can be optimized to be particularly fouling-resistant or energy-efficient or for high performance. <br><br>That opens up a wide range of applications for the company and its customers in the treatment of process water and wastewater in many different industries. An additional important area of application is the recovery of potable water from brackish or seawater. LANXESS and its products make important contributions in this field, facilitating access to clean drinking water for an ever-growing world population. <br><br>&#x201C;In addition to the quality and performance of our products, the innovative spirit and creativity of our employees have been particularly responsible for our membrane elements establishing a firm place in the market in just a few years,&#x201D; Vesselle said. One example of this innovation is a new type of multi-function spacer inside the membrane elements. This &#x201C;feedspacer&#x201D; consists of filaments of different thicknesses, which explains the designation &#x201C;Alternating Strand Design&#x201D; (ASD). It was brought to market in record time and is now helping to increase the energy efficiency of the corresponding membrane elements and simultaneously optimize fouling resistance.<br><br><b>The LANXESS Liquid Purification Technologies business unit</b><br><br>The LANXESS Liquid Purification Technologies (LPT) business unit currently employs 500 people worldwide, more than 300 of which work in Germany.

At the All China Leather Exhibition (ACLE) taking place in Shanghai from August 31 to September 2, 2016, the company will showcase its products, processes and systems for the efficient and sustainable production of a wide variety of leather articles. &#x201C;This year, our trade fair exhibit focuses on new developments for the manufacture of waterproof leather products, a new fluorine-free product for anti-soiling topcoats and a modular system for sustainably produced crust leather,&#x201D; says Luis L&#xF3;pez-Rem&#xF3;n, Head of the LANXESS Leather business unit (LEA).<br><br><b>Suitable for outdoor activities</b><br><br>LANXESS has developed Levotan W, a functionalized silicone-containing micro emulsion for the production of waterproof leathers. It is easily dispersible in the float and can be homogeneously incorporated in the leather to promote even dyeing. It can be used, for instance, for the manufacture of lightweight upper leathers for hiking and golf shoes that are waterproof but still breathable, which translates into greater comfort. &#x201C;Leather made with this product displays a fine grain, high water vapor permeability and a natural feel. Moreover, Levotan W yields high and reproducible measurements in both dynamic tests to Bally and Maeser, and static tests to determine water absorption,&#x201D; states Dr. Thomas Brackemeyer, Head of Business Line Organic Leather Chemicals (BL OLC) in the LANXESS Leather business unit.<br><br><b>Lasting protection against soiling</b><br><br>In addition to its fluorocarbon-based anti-soiling additives, LANXESS now also markets a halogen-free product. Aquaderm X-Shield HPS effectively reduces the soiling of light-colored leather and improves its cleanability. It is applied as usual to the leather as a topcoat and adheres to the surface. &#x201C;Light-colored leathers are still the trend, but they are a challenge for leather producers because soiling is more quickly visible on these color tones,&#x201D; says Brackemeyer. &#x201C;With our new anti-soiling additive, we now offer a fluorine-free alternative for achieving proven Aquaderm X-Shield protection. We see great potential for this sustainable innovation in the automotive, furniture and upper leather industries,&#x201D; he says. <br><br><b>New modular system for sustainable crust leather</b><br><br>Crusts are open-pore, unfinished leathers. A new modular system is now available for so-called &#x201C;green crust&#x201D; leather, used to produce sustainable leather products. The system includes products, processes, competent support and on-site technical service. Named &#x201C;X-Crust Technology&#x201D; it further includes the enzymatic X-Zyme process for the beamhouse steps, developed together with Denmark-based Novozymes A/S, the global market leader in enzymes: using two microbially produced enzymes in soaking and liming considerably increase the quality of the hides, reduce the amount of waste and significantly improve the efficiency of the entire process. The easy-to-use kit also includes the chrome-free tanning material X-Tan, the highly concentrated, eutectic preservative U-Tec G for wet blue, wet white and vegetable-tanned leathers, and retanning materials from the Levotan X-Biomer line. The latter are based on biodegradable polymers that are derived from renewable raw materials and functionalized for retanning applications in a biotechnological process. With these products, chrome-tanned leathers can be produced that even meet the stringent technical requirements imposed on automotive applications and children&apos;s shoes, also with regard to rising demands and voluntary zero discharge standards. <br><br>Dr. Dietrich Tegtmeyer, Vice President Leather Industry Relations and Head of Global Product Development for Crusting at LEA, will be telling the leather industry more about this subject in his presentation, &#x201C;X-Crust Technology &#x2013; A conceptual approach to sustainable crust production&#x201D; on August 30, 2016, in Shanghai at the Leather Forum Tannery of the Future.<br><br><b>Sustainable Leather Management for added sustainability </b><br><br>Sustainability has become essential in the leather industry. The demand for ecologically safe leathers is on the rise. In its Sustainable Leather Management program, LANXESS offers innovative technologies that more strongly support the production of sustainable, ecologically compatible products and processes in the leather industry, without making any compromises on quality. The company&#x2019;s products offer measurable advantages when it comes to reduced emissions and a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint, helping to save energy and protect the climate. In addition to more efficient production, processing and recycling, the objective is to manage the raw material and the associated waste even more responsibly. In its efforts, the specialty chemicals company already ensures compliance with the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MSRL) issued by the brand campaign for Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC).<br><br>For more detailed information on products and services for the leather industry, go to our website at <a href=\"http://www.lanxessleather.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.lanxessleather.com</a>.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 7.9 billion in 2015 and about 16,600 employees in 29 countries.

Now the products from the successful Bayferrox range are to do the same for the Sports Park in Barra da Tijuca, Brazil. &#x201C;From August 5 to 21, 2016, when 10,000 athletes from 166 countries compete in 28 sporting events at the summer games in Rio, both the participants and spectators will literally be walking on  LANXESS,&#x201D; says J&#xF6;rg Hellwig, head of the LANXESS Inorganic Pigments business unit. That&#x2019;s because much of the area around the venues is colored with black and red pigments from LANXESS.<br><br><b>Premium pigments for design and safety</b><br><br>The &quot;Olympic Way&quot;, a boulevard of black and light gray concrete paving stones, meanders along the entire stretch from the entrance, past the 15 venues, to the tip of the triangular grounds. The eight-centimeter-thick stones, placed in a wave shape, symbolize the confluence of the Rio Negro and Rio Solim&#xF5;es (Amazon River). The black-water Rio Negro gets its dark coloring form its high content of humic and fulvic acids, while the white-water Rio Solim&#xF5;es looks white when viewed at an angle on account of the mineral-based solids suspended in it. The rivers flow adjacent to one another over a distance of 11 kilometers before eventually converging. The concrete paving stones symbolizing this &#x201C;Meeting of the Waters&#x201D; were manufactured with over 40 metric tons of the iron oxide black pigments Bayferrox 318 and Bayferrox 340.<br><br>Numerous quiet zones around the venues are also of colored design, as is the large square in front of the public viewing park right off the boulevard. Their prominent red coloring comes from Bayferrox pigments. Drainage stones measuring 40x40x8 centimeters and colored with over 20 metric tons of Bayferrox 110 have been laid over more than 12,000 square meters of the park. These highly water-permeable paving stones prevent puddles from forming after heavy rainfall.<br><br>Bayferrox pigments are also a prominent feature in the athlete&#x2019;s village: the microasphalt for the cycle paths here was colored with Bayferrox 130 iron oxide red pigment. The red coloring helps to enhance traffic safety by clearly marking the cycle paths as separate from the gray concrete pedestrian walkways. Even after the games are over, the colored surfaces will retain their brilliant appearance for decades to come thanks to the pigments&#x2019; outstanding weather resistance.<br><br><b>Sustainability first</b><br><br>Sustainability was of major importance to the organizers in designing the Sports Park in Barra da Tijuca. For example, water cisterns and treatment plants have been installed, and the subsequent utilization of the area as a new city quarter was included in the planning process from the outset.  LANXESS, with all its various business fields, is a strong partner for sustainability. Its production processes are designed to conserve resources and preserve the environment &#x2013; and to be safe and sustainable. All production facilities are certified to DIN ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 and audited regularly. State-of-the-art waste gas and wastewater treatment facilities at the respective sites help to avoid emissions almost entirely.

The winning development involves the addition of local tape reinforcements to Tepex-brand thermoplastic composite sheets in order to optimize mechanical performance, material thickness and weight.<br><br><b>Optimizing standardized CFRTs</b><br><br>Continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRT), also referred to as composite sheets, have good potential for use in lightweight construction and are very easy to process. They can be manufactured continuously, have an unlimited shelf life and thus offer tangible economic advantages. Conventional fabrics with a 0&#xB0;/90&#xB0; fiber alignment are ideal for most reinforced structures, such as components in motor vehicles, and also housings on electronic devices and athletic equipment. The balanced fabric supports a variety of applications that can significantly reduce weight compared to metal or other plastics.<br><br>However, for special load situations, and to further optimize the flow of forces, reinforcements can be integrated using multiaxial Tepex, a recent advancement at Bond-Laminates. With this method, different fiber alignments can be selected for the layers of the composite structure. Referred to density, significantly enhanced performance can be achieved. The method makes designing components subject to heavy loads, such as brake pedals and seat structures, very easy and efficient.<br><br>For special applications requiring even further local reinforcement of load paths, high-performance structures can be optimized using this E-Profit approach, in which the precise number of unidirectional high-performance reinforcements, called &#x201C;tapes&#x201D;, are used that correspond to a given load path. This enables the load to be optimized in a similar manner to using different sheet thicknesses or reinforcements, but at a considerably reduced weight. Dirk Bonefeld, head of Research and Development at Bond-Laminates in Brilon said: &#x201C;The method we developed rounds out the high-end range of our Tepex-brand performance thermoplastic composites. The partners on this research project engineered an innovative method for cleverly combining different types of semi-finished composites. It demonstrates the development potential of our fiber composite technology.&#x201D;<br><br><b>JEC Innovation Awards Program</b><br><br>The evaluation criteria in this international competition are outstanding technical solutions, collaboration between development partners, market potential and the originality of the product or process. In attendance at the award ceremony on May 4 in Atlanta was Megan Jennings, account manager in the United States for the Tepex product in the LANXESS High Performance Materials business unit, who said: &#x201C;We are proud to receive an award in this major competition in the composites industry. It&apos;s a very gratifying form of recognition of our know-how in the field of composite materials.&#x201D;<br><br><br>The E-Profit project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) as part of its framework concept &#x201C;Research for the Production of Tomorrow,&#x201D; and overseen by the Karlsruhe Research Center (PTKA).

The exhibition is dedicated to the company&apos;s proven Lewatit-brand ion exchange resins for demineralization, removing arsenic from drinking water and heavy metals from wastewater, and to its Lewabrane reverse osmosis membrane elements. Sergey Shilov, head of the Liquid Purification Technologies (LPT) business unit for Russia, emphasizes the significance of the trade fair: &#x201C;As one of the leading trade fairs for the water industry in the Russian-speaking world, Ecwatech is the ideal platform for expanding our market presence and cultivating customer relationships. We also want to present ourselves to the industry as an innovative, competent and reliable partner.&#x201D; Shilov sees Russia and CIS countries as a key market for LANXESS&apos;s water treatment business: &#x201C;Russian government has initiated programs to improve water management, including investments in water infrastructure projects and environmental protection. We expect the programs aimed at modernizing water treatment plants to contribute significantly to our business success in Russia.&#x201D; <br><br>Russia&apos;s target program, &#x201C;Water Management Development from 2012 to 2020,&#x201D; supports the investment of RUB 520.6 billion (approx. EUR 6.6 billion) in constructing and modernizing wastewater treatment plants, water lines, water reservoirs and other water infrastructure systems, but also in environmental protection. &#x201C;We can assist water treatment plant operators in their efforts with our ion exchange resins and membrane elements, particularly in combination with our technical applications expertise and our proprietary Lewaplus design software.&#x201D;<br><br><b>Ion exchange resins for requirements in Russia </b><br><br>Worldwide demand for products that remove arsenic from drinking water has risen dramatically. Health studies have shown that the long-term consumption of contaminated drinking water containing even low concentrations of arsenic of just a few parts per billion (ppb) can increase the risk of cancer or changes in the skin. Therefore, in accordance with WHO recommendations, many countries have set the maximum permitted value of arsenic in drinking water at 10 ppb, equivalent to 10 micrograms per liter. <br><br>Lewatit FO36 is a high-performance hybrid adsorber comprising a plastics-based anion exchange resin and an iron oxide with a goethite structure. By a special production method, the iron oxide is distributed in the pores of the slightly alkaline ion exchange resin in a layer just a few nanometers thick. This fine and thus highly reactive iron oxide layer can selectively bind the arsenic. Only the arsenic is removed because, unlike other anionic components in water, such as chloride, nitrate, sulfate and carbonate, it alone has a high affinity for the iron oxide surface. The other mineral substances &#x2013; some of which are nutrients &#x2013; remain in the drinking water.<br><br>Lewatit MonoPlus TP 207 is a weakly acidic, macroporous cation exchange resin with chelating iminodiacetate groups for the selective extraction of heavy metal cations from weakly acidic to slightly alkaline solutions. It is characterized by a monodisperse particle size distribution, meaning it comprises beads of uniform size. Its superior kinetic behavior results in the faster uptake of ions and better capacity utilization compared to ion exchange resins with a heterodisperse particle size distribution. It is particularly suitable for the concentration, extraction and recovery of heavy metals from hydrometallurgical solutions, the removal of metal contaminants from processing baths, the recovery of useful metals from electroplating rinses, the selective removal of trace heavy metals from wastewater and from groundwater for the production of potable water.<br><br><b>Pooled competence for water treatment</b><br><br>LANXESS&apos;s membrane elements for reverse osmosis, marketed under the brand name Lewabrane, also serve the treatment of brackish water and seawater. &#x201C;Currently, tens of thousands of our elements are in use in more than two dozen countries around the world, including Russia,&#x201D; explained Alexander Scheffler, Director of Membrane Business in the LPT business unit. &#x201C;To meet the rising demand, we will be doubling the capacity of our production facility in Bitterfeld by 2017,&#x201D; continued Scheffler. LANXESS membrane elements boast a long service life, a good permeate yield, effective salt rejection and low energy requirements. Innovative models recently became available with a novel feed spacer in which the mesh comprises strands of alternating thickness. The new product family is named after this alternating strand design (ASD) and will be premiered at Ecwatech in Russia.<br><br>LANXESS&apos;s technological and application expertise in membrane technology and ion exchange are continuously being incorporated into its LewaPlus design software. A new module of this software tool is now available that enables calculations of condensate treatment in water-steam circuits. These circuits are very widespread in industry, specifically in the power plant sector, and often place high and very specific demands on water quality.<br><br>Detailed information about LANXESS products can be obtained online at <a href=\"http://lpt.lanxess.com/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lpt.lanxess.com/en/home/</a>.

One synergy effect is the more efficient utilization of phosphorus plants operated by the company at various sites worldwide. Following a comprehensive efficiency analysis, the phosphoric acid partial ester Additin RC 3760, previously shipped only from Mannheim, will now also be produced at the LANXESS site in Epierre, France, effectively doubling manufacturing capacity for this product. Additin RC 3760 is a proven anticorrosion and antiwear additive with a long history of success in metalworking fluids, hydraulic and industrial oils. <br><br>&#x201C;We use an identical manufacturing process in France,&#x201D; explains Martin S&#xE4;we, head of the Lubricant Additives business line in LANXESS&apos; ADD business unit. &#x201C;The product fulfills the same specifications and quality requirements as the Additin RC 3760 shipped from Mannheim. However there is one difference: while we have to buy-in phosphorus pentoxide in Mannheim, we are backwards integrated in France even as far as processing elementary phosphorus, meaning we have a more secure position.&#x201D; And that benefits customers: the added production site significantly increases supply security and, ideally, delivery times can now be considerably shorter.<br><br>The expanded capacities give LANXESS new opportunities: the company can utilize its phosphorus chemistry plants at both sites more efficiently, and adapt Additin RC 3760 for use in even more additive packages.<br><br>&#x201C;In addition, we now have new options for manufacturing phosphoric acid partial esters, which have not been produced on an industrial scale at LANXESS to date,&#x201D; explains S&#xE4;we. &#x201C;It makes us much more flexible in developing new products based on phosphoric acid esters. Additin RC 3760 from France is just the first step. We already have plans for additional products.&#x201D; By combining all these activities in ADD, the company&apos;s existing know-how in phosphorus chemistry can be exploited much more efficiently. &#x201C;We are phosphoric acid ester experts,&#x201D; explains Karsten Job, head of the Plastic Additives business line at ADD. &#x201C;This chemistry makes up a large part of our business.&#x201D; The LANXESS phosphoric acid esters that are used, for instance, as flame retardants and phthalate-free plasticizers in polyurethanes and PVCs, are similar to those marketed to the lubricants industry. In some cases, they even comprise of the same molecules. &#x201C;The obvious next step was to combine our plants and our expertise.&#x201C;</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.0 billion in 2014 and about 16,300 employees in 29 countries.

The company will underline its credentials as a strong partner for the plastics industry that both supplies its customers with innovative materials and provides reliable support throughout the entire development chain of the component &#x2013; from the concept phase and computational design to mold construction, testing and start of series production.<br><br><b>Ready for large-scale series production &#x2013; multi-axially reinforced Tepex</b><br><br>One hot topic for the future are the new, multi-axially reinforced versions of the Tepex dynalite thermoplastic high-performance composites. In these semi-finished composites, also known as composite sheets, the individual layers of continuous fiber can be arranged not only in the direction of production or perpendicular to it, as was previously possible, but at nearly any desired angle. As Martin Klocke from Technical Marketing and Business Development for Tepex automotive applications in the High Performance Materials (HPM) business unit of LANXESS explains, &#x201C;this means laminates can be built up with multi-axial reinforcement to precisely meet the specific load requirements of the component. Fully exploiting the potential of fiber direction results in thinner &#x2013; and therefore lighter &#x2013; designs at comparable strength.&#x201D;<br><br><b>Thermally conductive &#x2013; new polyamides for LEDs</b><br><br>For LED lighting technology, LANXESS will be showcasing new reinforced polyamide 6 compounds from the Durethan brand at Fakuma. These compounds conduct heat efficiently while at the same time being electrically insulating. Their thermal conductivity lies between 0.8 and 3 W/mK. Possible applications include cooling elements that dissipate the heat generated by LEDs, thus preventing any decline in brightness or lifespan. Highly reinforced, white, light-reflecting and halogen-free flame-retardant material grades are also in development, for example. &#x201C;Our calculation expertise enables us to construct LED components in a perfect plastic design in terms of heat dissipation,&#x201D; says Thomas Malek, New Business Development Manager LED at HPM. <br><br><b>Circuit breakers &#x2013; one material for several performance classes</b><br><br>Among the innovative materials for the electrical/electronics (E/E) industry are reinforced, but nonetheless very low-distortion polyamide and PBT compounds and extremely easy-flowing PBT variants for the cost-effective production of thin-walled components. Holger Mersmann, head of E/E sales at HPM, says: &#x201C;One special feature, for example, is a glass-reinforced, halogen-free flame-resistant polyamide 6. With its high thermal stability and mechanical strength, it represents an alternative to corresponding mineral-filled polyamide 6 grades. Since it can be used in different performance classes, our customers now only need one material instead of several, which reduces complexity and ultimately cuts costs.&#x201D;<br><br><b>Wide range of potential body panel applications </b><br><br>LANXESS has built up a wide variety of polyamides and polyesters for car and truck exterior body panel parts under the Durethan (PA 6, PA 66) and Pocan (PBT) brands. This includes high-modulus grades for very stiff components, online-paintable PBT grades, low-warpage materials for high-precision applications (seamless look) and customized materials for parts that are at risk of high impact, such as front grills. &#x201C;Our products offer greater design flexibility than thermosetting systems such as sheet molding compounds, are lighter than metals and result in components with an outstanding surface and excellent paintability that do not require reworking,&#x201D; explains Sarah Sangermann, project manager for Exterior Body Panels at HPM. Highlights include the glass-sphere-filled PBT Pocan B 5220 XF for online-paintable, dimensionally stable fuel flaps and the non-reinforced PC+PET blend Pocan C 1206 for thin-walled front grills with class A high-gloss finish. </p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.0 billion in 2014 and about 16,300 employees in 29 countries.

SLOVNAFT, a.s. in Bratislava is the leading supplier of refinery products in Slovakia and it produces a broad range of petrochemical raw materials. The company is a member of the Hungarian MOL Group.<br><br>In December 2014, a total of 630 Lewabrane RO B400 HR membrane elements went into operation in the refinery complex&apos;s water treatment plant. HR stands for high rejection, because these elements support an unusually high level of salt rejection and thus ideal permeate quality. They have been running stably and reliably at Slovnaft for over eight months now.<br><br><b>High demands easily fulfilled</b><br><br>The raw water for the plant is sourced from the Danube. It contains between 320 and 400 mg/l dissolved solids with seasonally fluctuating organic fractions, and it displays an electric conductivity of up to 580 &#x3BC;S/cm. During treatment, it first undergoes chemical pretreatment (coagulation, flocculation) and ultra-filtration, before continuing on to the reverse osmosis (RO) system, which is divided into five separate lines, each equipped with 126 membrane elements. The three-stage demineralization facility can turn out up to 135 cubic meters of permeate per hour and line, and the maximum conductivity falls far below the target value stipulated by the operator of 15 &#x3BC;S/cm. The system has a permeate yield of up to 85 percent. In the subsequent cleaning stage, also mixed bed ion exchange resins from LANXESS&apos; Lewatit line are used to remove any remaining ionic compounds. The facility produces fully demineralized water that is available as boiler feed water for water-steam circuits and other technical purposes. <br><br>Calculations with the LewaPlus design software, developed specifically for Lewabrane and Lewatit products, already showed in the planning phase that permeate conductivities of less than 10 &#x3BC;S/cm could be expected. Accordingly, this meant less of a burden on the mixed bed ion exchange resins. &#x201C;We met all these expectations, and that makes us very optimistic about easily fulfilling all the performance guarantees we granted to the customer,&#x201D; Scheffler confirmed. <br><br><b>Significantly longer dwell times</b><br><br>Compared to the other membrane elements used in previous years, the new system displays significantly longer dwell times. &#x201C;We used to have to go through the cleaning regimen every four to six weeks, but the magnitude of pressure decline and the conductivity did not increase with the elements from LANXESS until after four months. After cleaning, the elements were back up to the same performance level as when they went into operation,&#x201D; said Peter &#x160;r&#xE1;mek, head of Slovnaft refinery.<br><br>Overall, the longer intervals between cleanings reduced the consumption of cleaning chemicals and increased the availability of the RO lines. Similarly, the low salt content of the permeate extends the regeneration intervals of the mixed bed ion exchange system, further cutting costs.<br><br>For detailed information on LANXESS&apos; complete product range for water treatment with reverse osmosis and ion exchange, go to <a href=\"http://www.lpt.lanxess.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.lpt.lanxess.com</a>.<br><br>The Liquid Purification Technologies business unit is part of the LANXESS Performance Chemicals segment, which generated sales of EUR 2,193 million in 2014. </p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.0 billion in 2014 and about 16,300 employees in 29 countries.

The comprehensive product range includes flame retardants, plasticizers, crosslinking agents, catalysts and hydrolysis stabilizer for rigid and flexible foams, coatings, elastomers, sealants and adhesives.<br><br>The focus will be on innovative halogen-free flame retardants that are based in part on a newly developed type of phosphorus chemistry. These are characterized by low fogging and scorching, making them ideal for use in the furniture and automotive industries. The new Disflamoll TP LXS 51092 grade was primarily developed for PU flexible foam and elastomers while Levagard TP LXS 51114 is especially suitable for flexible foam. Both flame retardants can be used in polyester as well as in polyether flexible foams. Foams manufactured using Levagard TP LXS 51114 even meet the German Association of the Automotive Industry&apos;s strict VDA 278 standard for the characterization of non-metallic materials in cars.<br><br>The established reactive flame retardant Levagard 4090 N is now available in improved quality owing to process optimizations. The lower acid number and water content ensure better processability, especially in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams. <br>LANXESS will also be exhibiting its phthalate-free plasticizers from the Mesamoll range for the first time at UTECH. They are ideal for the production of PU sealants or for use as cleaning agents for polyurethane processing equipment.<br><br><b>Even stronger together &#x2013; the new LANXESS Rhein Chemie Additives business unit<br></b><br>LANXESS has combined the activities of the former Rhein Chemie and Functional Chemicals business units with the specialties business of the previous Rubber Chemicals business unit to form the new Rhein Chemie Additives business unit. &#x201C;The merged businesses are not only optimally adapted to meet customers&#x2019; needs, they also complement each other perfectly. We stand for tailor-made solutions, top technical know-how and the ultimate in additives expertise,&#x201D; says Anno Borkowsky, head of the Rhein Chemie Additives business unit. &#x201C;We develop, produce and market additives, phosphorus chemicals and specialty chemicals and service products for the worldwide rubber, lubricants and plastics industries. We also manufacture organic and inorganic colorants.

Other focal points the specialty chemicals company LANXESS will be showcasing in Mannheim include a new, highly reinforced but at the same time exceptionally easy-flow Durethan polyamide 6, various Pocan polyesters for external bodywork parts and flame-retardant Durethan polyamides for automotive electrical and electronics circuits.<br><br><b>Significant increase in strength and stiffness</b><br><br>Among other articles, LANXESS will be using the underbody protection from a German compact car to demonstrate the advantages of Tepex as the overlay for locally reinforcing thermoplastic compression molded parts. The component is created in a DLFT (direct long fiber thermoplastic) process from a polypropylene compression molding compound. &#x201C;The Tepex dynalite 104-RG601 (PP&amp;GF) inserts triple the strength and energy absorption of the DLFT component,&#x201D; explains Arping. In Mannheim, LANXESS will also be showcasing a material innovation for the DLFT compression molding process in the shape of Durethan B 24 CM H2.0. This polyamide 6 has significantly better flow properties than conventional polyamide 6-based long-fiber molding compounds. It also produces no flue gases on extrusion. Furthermore, its heat resistance means the material can withstand the temperatures involved in cataphoretic painting (CP), thus offering a CP-capable alternative to polypropylenes in the DLFT process. As a sample application, LANXESS will be presenting the demonstration model of a trunk recess for a German sports car.<br><br>Examples of the hybrid molding process, where Tepex inserts are simultaneously molded and back-injected in an injection mold include the seat shell for a compact car. &#x201C;In the event of a crash, the component absorbs considerably more energy than comparable designs using sheet steel or plastics reinforced with long glass fibers. This provides a greater degree of safety,&#x201D; says Arping. The safety component is approximately 800 grams lighter than previous versions. <br><br><b>Extremely easy flowing despite 60 percent glass fibers</b><br><br>A new material for lightweight design being showcased in Mannheim is Durethan BKV 60 XF. Just like the series-tested Durethan DP BKV 60 H2.0 EF, this polyamide 6 is reinforced with 60 percent glass fibers. However, while its mechanical property profile is of a similarly high standard, its melt flow is more than 30 percent better. &#x201C;This enables the construction of strong structural components that exhibit intricate rib structures with wall thicknesses of less than one millimeter,&#x201D; says Arping.<br><br><b>New polyester for fuel caps that can be coated online</b><br><br>Pocan B 5220 XF &#x2013; a glass-bead-reinforced material specifically designed for fuel caps &#x2013; is one example of LANXESS&#x2019; material innovations for bodywork exteriors. It is dimensionally stable and withstands the temperatures involved in cataphoretic painting. &#x201C;In this application, we see it as an alternative to polyphenylene ether and polyamide blends and mineral reinforced PBT or polyamide compounds,&#x201D; explains Arping.<br><br><b>Flame-retardant polyamides with wide processing window</b><br><br>LANXESS will also be showcasing applications for halogen-free flame-retardant Durethan polyamides &#x2013; including a carrier for high-voltage components in the battery system of an electric vehicle. This is made from injection-molded Durethan BKV 20 FN01. Thanks to its organophosphorus flame retardance package, this extremely tough polyamide 6 achieved the best classification, V-0 (0.75 mm), in tests to the American standard UL 94 (Underwriter Laboratories). Arping: &#x201C;The special feature of this material is its wide processing window, which enables a reliable and stable injection molding process. Moreover, the material can also be processed at higher temperatures, meaning that longer and more complicated flow paths are also supported.&#x201D;</p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.3 billion in 2013 and about 16,700 employees in 29 countries.

This enables Tepex to be both formed in a fully automated, near-series process and also simultaneously formed and overmolded in a hybrid molding process. &#x201C;We plan to use the facility as a platform for transferring technology to customers. We want to familiarize our customers with the strengths of Tepex and how it is processed, as well as supporting the development of innovative components,&#x201D; explains Ulrich Jecmeniza, applications engineer with Bond-Laminates. In addition, production processes of Tepex processors are to be simulated for quality assurance and improvement purposes. Not least, Bond-Laminates aims to use the facility to drive forward its own material development. This new demonstration cell supplements a Technical Service Center facility that LANXESS already operates at the Dormagen site. <br><br><b>State-of-the-art technology</b><br><br>The cell is manufactured by ENGEL AUSTRIA GmbH. The Tepex inserts are introduced to the machine using a magazine with separation function, so that various Tepex sections can be processed in a single production run. A highlight of the facility is two pyrometrically controlled infrared furnaces with a &#x201C;drawer system&#x201D; that have been newly developed by ENGEL. These enable the inserts to be heated quickly in an even, material-specific way, without causing any damage to the thermoplastic matrix of Tepex. An ENGEL easix six-axis articulated arm robot with vacuum grippers adapted to Tepex takes over the handling of the inserts. &#x201C;The high speed involved in heating and handling the inserts ensures a high degree of reproducibility for the entire production process, even for very thin-walled components,&#x201D; says Jecmeniza. The injection molding facility in which the Tepex inserts are shaped and overmolded has a clamping force of 130 metric tons. The maximum projected size for the molded parts is 330 x 280 millimeters, which means that both structural and visible parts in these dimensions can easily be processed. Heat management in the mold can be either isothermal or variothermal as required. Variothermal mold temperature control results in distortion-free, high-gloss surfaces. The facility is also equipped with a clamping system and associated grippers for inserts with standardized section sizes. These kinds of sections are used to manufacture the specimens needed for testing to standard requirements in material development or shaping experiments, for example. &#x201C;The inclusion of both a clamping and a magazine system makes our demonstration cell very flexible and versatile, enabling it to cover a broad range of applications,&#x201D; says Jecmeniza. <br><br><b>Several molds for near-series prototype components</b><br><br>The new facility will initially be fitted with a mold for the sports goods industry. The relevant component consists of a Tepex section with TPU matrix that is overmolded with TPU on both sides after shaping. Other near-series molds will soon be available. Jecmeniza: &#x201C;This will enable us to cover applications for our most important customer groups &#x2013; that is to say the automobile, consumer electronics and sports goods industries.&#x201D;<br><br><b>Hybrid molding process on the up</b><br><br>The hybrid molding process is arousing considerable interest worldwide because it enables the cost-effective production of very lightweight, but still immensely strong structural components in large to extremely large volumes. Numerous international manufacturers of plastics machines have therefore now developed appropriate production plants and presented these at trade fairs &#x2013; as was recently seen at IPF 2014 in Tokyo. The innovative lightweight construction process will also be the focus of exhibits by various machinery providers at NPE (March 23 &#x2013; 27, 2015) in Orlando, United States, and Koplas (March 10 &#x2013; 14, 2015) in Seoul, South Korea. Manufacturers of other components in the hybrid molding process &#x2013; such as furnaces, fully automated handling systems, testing technology or molds &#x2013; are also hard at work, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for processors when they are selecting equipment.<br><br></p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.3 billion in 2013 and about 16,700 employees in 29 countries.

The subsidiary company Bond-Laminates, which manufactures these composites, is now able to continuously series-produce large semi-finished composite products in which the continuous fiber layers can be oriented at almost any conceivable angle. Until now, the continuous fibers in Tepex could only be lined up in the direction of production or perpendicular to it (0 degrees or 90 degrees). This process innovation means the designer can use the differently oriented composite continuous fibers to help him react more specifically to the force transmission in the target component. Even quasi-isotropic constructions can now be fashioned using Tepex. &#x201C;This means Tepex can be used to design lighter-weight composite components that are tailored even more specifically to the load in question. So the new-generation Tepex strengthens our position as a leading supplier of thermoplastic high-performance composites for lightweight design,&#x201D; says Dr. Dirk Bonefeld, head of Research and Development at Bond-Laminates. <br><br><b>Suitable for large-scale series production with minimal waste</b><br>These multiaxial Tepex semi-finished products are fully impregnated and consolidated. Despite being formable to quite extreme angles, their impregnation means the fibers are unlikely to slip. As in the past, Bond-Laminates will consult closely with the customer regarding cutting the semi-finished products into pre-contoured profiles for forming and overmolding or compressing. Special nesting programs help keep wastage to a minimum in almost all cases. &#x201C;Thus the processor receives a fully constructed, made-to-measure composite material that can be shaped into highly load-resistant, complex components in very short cycle times without generating wastage,&#x201D; says Bonefeld.<br><br><b>Unidirectional properties</b><br>Thanks to the continuous fibers&#x2019; high degree of orientation, the individual fiber layers demonstrate almost unidirectional properties. The stiffness and strength of the individual layers based on polyamide 6 and continuous glass fibers are 37 GPa and 780 MPa respectively in the direction of the fibers. <br><br><b>Broad spectrum of applications</b><br>Their high-quality mechanical set of properties, which can be tailored to meet specific requirements, makes multiaxial Tepex semi-finished products the perfect material for manufacturing high-strength structural components and semi-structural components for automobiles in particular. &#x201C;For example, we are currently working on front end carriers, pedal and seating components, carriers for electrical and electronic modules, engine compartment guard plates, airbag housings and components used in underbody protection. We are also looking at components that require custom construction for meeting a combination of torsional and flexural load requirements,&#x201D; Bonefeld adds. <br><br></p>\n      </div>\n      \n        \n          \n          \n            <div class=\"news-boilerplate-copy\">\n              <p>LANXESS is a leading specialty chemicals company with sales of EUR 8.3 billion in 2013 and about 16,900 employees in 31 countries.

And that is why many prominent companies worldwide employ Saltigo as a service partner for exclusive synthesis,&#x201D; says J&#xF6;rg Schneider. The head of Marketing at Saltigo GmbH in Leverkusen, Germany, is confident this profile will continue in the future to make the company an attractive partner for pharmaceutical companies around the world. &#x201C;What we offer goes far beyond simple custom synthesis or even contract manufacturing. In line with the strategic goals of our customers, we are doing our part to create value over the long-term,&#x201D; Schneider explains.<br><br>Saltigo, a wholly owned subsidiary of the specialty chemicals company  LANXESS, is showcasing this full spectrum of expertise at CPhI Worldwide. The world&#x2019;s leading trade fair for pharmaceutical intermediates and active ingredients is being held this year in Paris from October 7 to 9. <br><br><b>Implementing strategies &#x2013; managing projects &#x2013; creating value</b><br><br>For a supplier of exclusive synthesis aiming for a successful, collaborative partnership with its customer, one important prerequisite is a high degree of transparency with regard to facts and decision-making. That applies not only to scientific and technical questions, but also to strategic goals and overall business conditions &#x2013; all the time, of course while maintaining strict confidentiality and safeguarding intellectual property. And if the service partner can take on the selection of technology partners and raw materials suppliers, this taps into the potential for reducing complexity throughout the value chain, which in turn boosts efficiency. <br><br>&#x201C;That is where our systematic, comprehensive project management is the key to success. We have been developing it over many years, and continue to improve on it all the time,&#x201D; says Schneider. It ensures smooth project workflows that strike a balance between technical and business interests. Project managers and teams are responsible for the entire life cycle of their project, from acquisition and evaluation, through process development, scale-up and piloting, all the way to production. And a central steering committee coordinates all projects and the allocation of technical and personnel resources. The company&apos;s recent move to bring together production and management at one site in Leverkusen offers ideal conditions for this.<br><br><b>Basic and premium competencies for exclusive synthesis</b><br><br>The fundamental competencies of a provider of exclusive synthesis include supplying substances reliably, on schedule, at a high, consistent quality and in compliance with environmental and safety regulations. Working on such a firm footing, a company in the pharmaceutical industry can quickly and reliably reach its milestones, significantly reduce the time it takes for newly approved products to make their market debut, and achieve maximum security of supply with minimum warehouse inventory &#x2013; and thus minimum storage costs. <br><br>These requirements are also faced by synthesis providers in emerging economies, countries that have enjoyed very low production costs until recently. &#x201C;The production conditions in China and India, for example, have changed considerably,&#x201D; Schneider says. &#x201C;Salaries and labor costs are rising, laws and regulations are getting more stringent, and inspection standards are becoming more demanding. Production costs there are increasing, in other words, so these suppliers&apos; price advantage could potentially melt away.&#x201D; <br><br>The real added value for a customer who works with an experienced European provider of exclusive synthesis, like Saltigo, is in the additional services the company can offer. They are the key to efficient realization of a pharmaceutical company&apos;s strategic and financial objectives. &#x201C;These include our collaborative role in project planning, full-spectrum project management, raw materials procurement, process development, contributions in the area of supply chain management, and consultation and support with registration, to name just a few examples,&#x201D; says Schneider.\n</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Saltigo GmbH is a leading supplier in the field of custom synthesis.
